## Project Description
The initial phase of the AirBnB clone project focused on developing the backend of the application and integrating it with a console interface using the cmd module in Python. Throughout this phase, Python objects were created and managed, and the resulting data was stored in a JSON file format, which can be easily accessed using the json module in Python.

## Description of the command interpreter
The command-line interface of the application resembles the Bash shell, but with a specific set of accepted commands that were designed exclusively for the usage of the AirBnB website. This command-line interpreter serves as the front-end of the web application, allowing users to interact with the back-end, which was developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques in Python.

## How to start it
To start the console, you need to utilize the command: ./console.py.
